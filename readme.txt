This project serves to create a functional engima machine with traditional and historically accurate
cogs and reversers used within WW2. This program has additional functionality assocaited with an engima machine
such as backparsing (backspacing) and reset functions when operated key-by-key.

The project also contains the beginnings of a system that can cryptographically analyse a variety of english
fitness factors to given text. This is a demonstration of how those at Bletchley Park where able to use very
similar techniques as to what's being shown to preform known text attacks on the German encryption device.
