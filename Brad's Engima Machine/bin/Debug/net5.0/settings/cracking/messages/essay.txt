Accounting essay – City Hotel Limited 

City hotel limited is a small Ltd that owns a medium range of hotels in the city centre. They are looking to expand their business through an extension, of which costs £1m. The directors are seeking advice on two issues. These issues are surrounding the sources of finance used to generate funding for the new premises, as well as the refurbishment and alteration costs. To generate funding for a large purchase, such as a new premises, the company will require a long-term external source of finance. 

Firstly, issue one outlines that 70% of the original £1m cost of the new premises could be potentially financed through a commercial mortgage; a long-term bank loan which is secured on a property. The mortgage would last 15 years and requires a 5% interest rate per annum; the mortgage would cover £700,000 of the original cost however, would create an additional cost of £35,000 annual interest.
A benefit of a mortgage is that after the set period of time,15 years in this case, there are no additional repayments required, unlike shares or dividends. The repayments are also distributed in monthly instalments which could make it a more affordable, avoiding large sum payments damaging cash flow. A secondary benefit, linked to shares, is that there is no risk of losing control of the business; this is when more than 50% of the company is sold to ordinary shareholders.

However, a mortgage generates a finance cost through interest. Therefore, adding an additional annual expense of £35,000. Albeit, it is unknown whether the interest rate is fixed or variable to changes in the external economy such as inflation which could increase the interest rate.
The premises purchased will also act as security for the loan, therefore, if the business is unable to afford the repayments, the property is at risk of repossession. A mortgage usually requires a large initial deposit which could cause cash flow damage. A mortgage can also increase the level of capital gearing, which is a term that refers to the amount of debt a company has relative to its equity. 
On the occasion that the business cannot generate enough income to sustain the mortgage or interest, a second source of finance to aid these liabilities could be share capital; money invested by shareholders. 
The extract mentions that the company already has an issued share capital of £500,000, of £1 ordinary shares, which are owned by the four directors. However, the company may need to introduce additional shareholders to generate more capital. 

A benefit of share capital is that there are no repayments or interests due, unlike a loan, and dividends paid out on ordinary shares are solely based of what the company can afford. Secondly, there is no security needed; shares can reduce the level of capital gearing. Although, large amounts of dividends can damage cashflow and the debut of new shareholders means more profit has to be distributed, and as aforementioned, the risk of losing business control is introduced. 
Selling additional shares could be a difficult process. One reason is, City Hotel Limited is a private limited company, as such they cannot exploit the benefits of selling shares on the stock market. Additionally, they are described as a “small” company - therefore, they might not be easily recognised or desired for investment by shareholders. These obstacles could limit the availability of additional share capital, and could be an unreliable source of external finance to aid the mortgage repayments and finance costs.
Following this, we cannot make a definitive decision on the most suitable long-term source of finance for City Hotel Ltd as we do not know the full financial overview of the company other than the £500,000 of issued share capital, which is an insufficient level of information. 
Some additional data that could be useful is an income statement. This can be used to analyse the existing expenses of the company and how an additional finance cost would affect gross profit. 
A Statement of Financial Position can be used to evaluate whether the liquidity of the company can be sustained through the introduction of a new long-term liability and what effect this liability will have on the value of the company (NET assets). 
Finally, a statement of cash flows to ensure the company can afford this new purchase and to estimate the extent of potential damages to existing cash flow.

The premises City Hotel Ltd has planned to purchase requires refurbishments and structural alterations, which will need to be budgeted and financed. The extract illustrates that the accountant of the company has prepared budgeted financial statements for the next six months. These statements explain that the refurbishments and alterations will take approximately two months to complete, with a maximum overdraft figure of £40,000 at the end of month two; this is estimated to reduce for the following eight months of the year.
City Hotel Ltd would require a short-term source of finance such as, the bank overdraft; a negative balance on the business’ bank account. This is due to the refurbishments only taking an estimated two months to finish. It is a short-term external source of finance and it possesses a number of benefits; there is no risk of losing business control and is repaid when the business is able to do so. A bank overdraft is flexible, as the business only borrows and pays interest on the amount needed. A bank loan, in comparison, is a fixed figure and interest is charged on the full amount, regardless whether or not they utilise the full sum. 

However, a bank overdraft can introduce consequences. As previously quoted, the business is charged with interest on the amount borrowed, this is an additional cost to the company and is often declared at a higher rate in comparison to a bank loan. Following this, the extract specifies that the interest, of the overdraft, is 7% per annum; therefore, if the company is obligated to pay this sum on their estimated maximum balance of £40,000, then they would have to pay a supplementary £2,800. Additionally, the overdraft facility can be cancelled at any time by the bank - without notice. The company could have a greater risk of this if they have an imperfect financial history; meaning the company has historical evidence of late, omissive loan repayments or a bad credit score with their trade payables. Albeit, if this was the case, they may not be granted an overdraft to begin with.

City Hotel’s alternative short-term source of finance is a short-term bank loan. This bank loan would last twelve months with an interest rate of 6%. 
It is immediately noted that the interest rate is 1% lower than the bank overdraft; this could be more affordable. Yet, this is heavily dependable on the amount borrowed. Bank loans have limited flexibility, and the company may not have the capability to borrow the exact amount desired. The only difference between a long and short-term loan is the time the loan is granted for. A short-term loan has to be less than or up to twelve months whereas a long-term loan is over twelve months. In light of this both sources of finance share the same common benefits and consequence. 

As formally stated, the accountant of City Hotel Ltd has drafted budgeted financial statements. However, these are established on the assumption that the rooms in this new premises are completed within two months and are in demand by customers for the following 4 months. There are some external unknown factors that could influence this such as: seasonal cycle based on location (if City Hotel Ltd is based in a cold and rainy city centre and experiences unfavourable winters customers may not want to travel there and some customers may not enjoy staying in a hotel within a city centre), economic cycle (if there is an inflation on travel prices). 
Therefore, the budgeted financial statements could be inaccurate and easily influenced so much so that City Hotel Ltd may not be able to generate enough profit to repay the loan instalments connected to the new premises without additional finance.

In conclusion I believe that the most suitable source of finance for the premises is the original commercial mortgage detailed. This will cover £700,000 of the £1m overall cost however will add an additional £35,000 annual interest. Due to this, a second source of external finance that I believe will be particularly beneficial is an increase in share capital. This new capital can cover the other expenses of the purchase such as the £35,000 annual interest and aid in financing the further £300,000 from the original cost. Also, the introduction of new shareholders could potentially generate better opinion in management and specialised skill, as well as making the company more recognisable in the industry due to business expansion.
The added share capital could possibly provide enough equity to cover the expenses of the refurbishments and structural alterations. On the other hand, a second short term finance could be utilised to aid this. I believe this should be a short-term bank loan. Although a bank overdraft has better flexibility than a loan, the accountant has already forecasted a maximum value the overdraft would exceed; £40,000. Therefore, the company should consider obtaining a short-term loan of the same amount, this would also mean the company only has to pay 6% interest rather than 7%. Yet this decision would diminish the advantage of paying the amount borrowed when the business can afford to so the company would potentially become more dependable on either: share capital or customer demand (which creates more revenue and profit).
