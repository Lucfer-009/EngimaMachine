!!Please note!!

This project is still only in early development. It is very much the minimum viable product.
There may be bugs or unpredictable behaviour, but I hope it'll be minimal.

There is no GUI here and there is no prior explanation as to how the Engima machine works.
This is very much targeted toward a user who has some knowledge of the machine.

There was meant to be an additional segment of the program that would attempt to preform
crytographic attacks upon engima cyphertext without a plaintext refrence. However, due to
time restraints a more minimalistic program was created; of which scores text upon how much
like english it is. It uses many time accurate techniques that those at Bletchley Park used
to crack Engima, and are still used today in cryptographic analysis. Such as n-gram frequency
and index of coincidence.

I hope you enjoy the project.
